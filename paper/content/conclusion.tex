\todo{Conclusion needs to conclude (pontificate and look to the horizon), and state limitations of our approach.}

We have shown that dependently typed languages satisfy the core requirements from the \emph{Language Workbench Challenge}~\cite{DBLP:conf/sle/ErdwegSVBBCGHKLKMPPSSSVVVWW13}.

\Velo{}'s \emph{notation} as a \ac{dsl} is, by design, textual, and the internal core bounded by \Idris{} own notation requirements.
%
More importantly the \emph{semantics} (statics and dynamics) of \Velo{} are verified as part of the implementation because of the dependently typed setting.
%
The weakest core criteria is that of \emph{editor} support.
%
Languages created through \Idris{} do not get an editor, they are free form languages.

%
There are, however, more criteria from the feature model to consider:
%
semantic \& syntactic services for editors;
%
testing \& debugging;
%
and
%
composability.
%

With the rise of the \ac{lsp} it would be a good idea to look at how we can derive \ac{lsp} compatible language servers generically, thus addressing the missing provision of the optional semantic and syntactic services.
\Idris{} itself provides an \emph{IDE-Protocol}, and there is support for the \ac{lsp} in \Idris{} itself
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/idris-community/idris2-lsp}}.

\jfdm{The IDE-Protocol was presented at DTP 2014 (\url{https://davidchristiansen.dk/pubs/dtp2014-idris-mode.pdf}) we could cite}

Our languages also do not come with the ability to test and debug their implementation.
These are important aspects even thought our languages are \emph{certified}.
%
We need to validate that our verified code is doing what we want it to do.

\jfdm{I have no idea how to expand this properly without it obvious that I waffle.}

Finally there is language composability, an advantageous idea to reuse existing languages when designing new ones.
This is a hard problem
The \emph{Effects} library~\cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/Brady13} provides clues as to how we can compose \acp{dsl} horizontally but not vertically.
\jfdm{I have no idea how to expand this properly with it obvious I am waffling.}

With future engineering satisfying these missing criteria is permissible.

\jfdm{If there is space, a paragraph on Idris2 as a workbench would be good.}
