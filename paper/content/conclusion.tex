We have shown that dependently typed languages satisfy the core requirements from the \emph{Language Workbench Challenge}~\cite{DBLP:conf/sle/ErdwegSVBBCGHKLKMPPSSSVVVWW13}, and that the optional requirement of language verification comes easily.
%
There are, however, more criteria from the feature model to consider:
semantic \& syntactic services;
testing \& debugging;
and
composability.
%


Languages created through \Idris{} do not get an editor, they are free form languages.
%
With the rise of the \acf*{lsp} it would be a good idea to look at how we can derive language servers for our \acp{dsl}, thus addressing the provision of semantic and syntactic services missing.


Our languages also do not come with the ability to test and debug their implementation.

Finally there is language composability.
\jfdm{I have no idea how to expand this properly with it obvious I am waffling.}


With future engineering satisfying these missing criteria is permissible.
