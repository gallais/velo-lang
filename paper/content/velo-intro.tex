\chcomment{Whole pipeline (parser, elaborator, REPL, evaluator, compiler passes)}

The design behind \Velo{} is purposefully unsurprising:
%
it is \emph{just} the \ac{stlc} extended with booleans and natural numbers with binary conjunction and addition operations as primitives.
%
To promote the idea of interactive editing \Velo{} also supports well-typed holes.
%
Such a featherweight language design helps us to showcase better how we can use dependently-typed languages as language workbenches.

\jfdm{Do we need to evidence (through citation) benefits of featherweight languages?}

\begin{Verbatim}
let a = zero in let b = (inc a) in let c = (add a b) in
let d = true in let e = false   in let f = (and d e) in
let foo = (fun x : nat => x)
in (foo ?hole)
\end{Verbatim}

We have presented \Velo{} as a \emph{complete} language with a standard compiler pipeline, and REPL. % there is \ac{repl} if we need it.
%
A \ac{dsl} captures the language's concrete syntax, and a parser turns \ac{dsl} instances into raw unchecked terms.
%
Bidirectional type checking elaborates these raw terms into a set of well-typed \acp{ir}:
%
\IdrisType{Holey} supports well-scoped typed holes;
%
and
%
\IdrisType{Terms} our core representation that captures our language's abstract syntax.
%
We present the interesting aspect of our \ac{ir} design in \Cref{sec:design:holes}.
%
Further, elaboration performs standard syntax transformations that turns let-bindings into function application.
%
From the core representation we also provide well-scoped \ac{cse} using co-\DeBruijn{} indexing (\Cref{sec:compiler-pass}), and we provide a verified evaluator to reduce terms to values (\Cref{sec:semantics}).

A key tenet in language workbenches, such as Spoofax, is the \emph{ease} at which language's can be created.
To that same degree, we have also sought to develop a series of reusable modules that captures functionality common to many languages.
Thus reducing the \emph{boilerplate} required when creating \acp{edsl} in \Idris{}.
