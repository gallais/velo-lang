\emph{Language Workbenches}, such as Spoofax~\cite{DBLP:journals/software/WachsmuthKV14}, offers language designers an expressive environment in which to design, implement, and deploy their \Acp{dsl}~\cite{hudak1996building}.
Another interesting environment to develop \acp{dsl} is that of dependently-typed languages such as Idris~\cite{DBLP:conf/ecoop/Brady21}, Agda~\cite{DBLP:conf/afp/Norell08}, and Coq~\cite{}.
Such languages provides us with an expressive environment in which to reason not only about our software programs but also about the programming languages in which we write our programs.
We have seen the use of dependent types to provide the mechanised reasoning of core language calculi~\cite{10.1145/3093333.3009866,DBLP:conf/cpp/RouvoetPKV20,DBLP:conf/mpc/ChapmanKNW19}.
These applications of mechanised software verification are wasted if we also do not seek to run these programs as well!
If it type checks, we might as well ship it too!

Uses of dependent-typed to realise \acp{dsl} raises an important question:
\emph{Are dependently-typed languages language workbenches?}
Criteria has been developed to detail what a language workbench is~\cite{DBLP:conf/sle/ErdwegSVBBCGHKLKMPPSSSVVVWW13}.
Principally speaking a language workbench is a tool supports:
description of a language's \emph{notation}---how we present a language's concrete syntax to users;
implementation of a language's \emph{semantics}---how we realise how a language operates;
and
user interaction through an \emph{editor}.
Outside of this core criteria other language work benches support language validation, testing, and composition.
It is easily demonstrated from extant work that dependently-typed languages support the production of verified language implementations, but what about the other required and optional criteria?


\Velo{} is a minimal functional language that we have realised in Idris to showcase dependently typed techniques to implement and manipulate \acp{ir}.
This paper introduces \Velo{} but that also though the auspices of \Velo{} itself that dependently-typed languages make a fine language workbench according to the core criteria for a language workbench, and that with future engineering we can satisfy more of the optional criteria.
