\begin{abstract}
We are planning to showcase dependently typed techniques to implement \& manipulate IRs.

The key components we are planning to treat are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Efficient de Bruijn representations
\item Co de Bruijn for CSE
\item Evaluation as Progress (with computation rules in one separate function)
\item Well scoped holes
\item Linear (in number of cases) decidable equality
\item Compact constant folding
\item Positive evidence for negative statements
\item Whole pipeline (parser, elaborator, REPL, evaluator, compiler passes)
\end{itemize}

Our ongoing work is available at:

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

A \emph{Language Workbench} offers language designers an expressive environment in which to design and implement their \Acp{dsl}.
\chcomment[id=jfdm]{Needs extending.}

Dependently-typed languages such as Idris~\cite{DBLP:conf/ecoop/Brady21} provides programmers with an expressive environment in which to reason not only about their software programs but more importantly about the \emph{programming languages} in which we write our programs.
There is a plethora of work attesting to the ability of dependent-types to reason about the programming languages we all use, and textbooks such as \emph{Programming Language Foundations in Agda}~\cite{plfa22.08} and \emph{Software Foundations}~\cite{Pierce:SF2} detail how others can learn to develop mechanised formal descriptions of their languages.
\chcomment[id=jfdm]{Needs extending.}

The formal design of a programming language is, however, just one aspect of he language's lifecycle.
Programming languages are also to be used.
Dependently-typed languages such as Idris also supports the efficient execution of our `reasoned about' software programmes and the programming languages described.
\chcomment[id=jfdm]{Needs extending.}

This paper presents \Velo{} a minimal functional language based on the \ac{stlc} combined with an extended form of \emph{Hutton's Razor} that show cases how we can use languages, such as Idris, as a language workbench.
